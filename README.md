## Virtual Tabletop
I am very unsatisfied with the state of virtual tabletops that currently exist, so I decided to make my own. At first I will make D&D playable, with good battlemap experience, playersheets, SRD and multi language support. I may add scripting support in the future, so everyone can add whatever TTRPG they want.
